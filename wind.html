            <h2>What is Wind Energy?</h2>
            <p>
              One potential solution for generating electricity within homes involves taking advantage of  wind. Turbines, similar to those used on wind farms though of smaller size, can be implemented in homes as a source of energy, by either attaching them to poles or directly into a building. This method would rely on using the movement of air to rotate the wind turbine’s blades to produce electricity. Overall, utilizing a wind turbine can help provide clean energy at a reduced cost for homeowners. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As of 2022, wind energy contributed over 2000 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, representing more than 7% of global electricity production and approximately 2% of total global energy consumption. The continuous expansion of wind power capacity, with over 100 gigawatts (GW) added in 2021 alone, has pushed global installed wind power capacity beyond 800 GW.

        <h2>Turbine Blades</h2>
        <p>Most turbines have three blades which are made mostly of fiberglass. Turbine blades vary in size, but a typical modern land-based wind turbine has blades of over 170 feet</p>
      </div>
      <div class="solution-box" id="box2">
        <h2>Drivetrain</h2>
        <p>The drivetrain on a turbine is comprised of the rotor, main shaft, gearbox, and generator. The drivetrain converts the low-speed, high-torque rotation of the turbine's rotor into electrical energy. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="solution-box" id="box3">
        <h2>Turbine Beam</h2>
        <p>Beam holds the blades and drivetrain in place. Some turbines extend up to 300 feet in the air. Smaller home turbines extend only a few yards in the air.</p>

              Since a wind turbine's ability to produce electricity is reliant on the weather, this solution might be more effective in some places than others. 
              Even in areas that may experience frequently windy conditions, it is important to consider factors such as which directions wind generally blows in as well as positioning the windmill in a way where it is not obstructed by anything such as trees or other buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is recommended that the installation of a small wind turbine is performed by professionals with expertise and credibility in the field. On the consumer's end, there might be some maintenance involved for the turbine including checking and tightening bolts or electrical connections, checking machines for corrosion, and replacing components of the turbine such as the blades. If all of this is done properly, the system should last for at least 20 years.

            <h2>What does it cost?</h2>
            <p>
              The way a turbine operates is through the wind which causes its blades to spin, thus rotating the rotor within which subsequently spins a generator to produce electricity. Depending on the size and specifications of the wind turbines in question, the amount of electricity generated may vary significantly. According to some estimates for example, a wind turbine with a range between five to 15 kilowatts can help meet the needs of a standard home, which uses approximately 10,649 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Industrial wind turbines typically cost in the $2-4 million dollar range.
              However, smaller turbines can now cost no more than a few thousand dollars, but energy production will vary greatly to the size, specs and wind conditions of a person's home.
              Maintenance costs can vary depending on the size of the turbine but they typically run $40-50,000 for larger turbines and in the hundreds of dollars for smaller turbines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep in mind that factors like site suitability, local regulations (zoning laws), and access to incentives or rebates can further influence the overall financial feasibility of wind energy adoption for homeowners. Despite these costs, wind energy offers the potential for sustainable and environmentally friendly power generation, contributing to reduced reliance on traditional fossil fuels.
