            <h2>What are Heat Pumps?</h2>
            <p>
              Heat pumps are highly efficient heating and cooling systems that extract heat from the air, water, or ground and transfer it to indoor spaces for heating or remove it from indoor spaces for cooling. They work on the principle of thermodynamics and are widely used in residential, commercial, and industrial settings.
              Because they transfer heat rather than generate heat, heat pumps can efficiently provide comfortable temperatures for your home. 
            </p>
            <p>
              There are three main types of heat pumps:  <a href = "https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/air-source-heat-pumps" style = "text-decoration: none; color: green;">Air Source Pumps</a> (The most common type which transfers heat between your house and the outside air), 
              <a href = "https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/geothermal-heat-pumps" style = "text-decoration: none; color: green;">Geothermal Heat Pumps</a> (Transfers heat between your house and the ground or a nearby water source) and <a href = "https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/absorption-heat-pumps" style = "text-decoration: none; color: green;">Absorption Heat Pumps</a> (gas-fired heat pumps that use thermal energy as their energy source)
            </p>
            <p>
              Heat pumps stand out as a environmentally advantageous solution compared to traditional methods like furnaces and air conditioners due to their higher efficiency and utilization of renewable energy sources.
              By extracting heat from the air, water, or ground, heat pumps minimize reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels, reducing carbon emissions.

        <h2>Fan</h2>
        <p>
          The outdoor unit contains a fan that blows air over the condenser coil, facilitating heat transfer.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="solution-box" id="box2">
        <h2>Compressor</h2>
        <p>
          The absorbed heat causes the refrigerant liquid to evaporate into a low-pressure gas inside the outdoor unit of the heat pump. 
          The compressor within the heat pump then compresses the gaseous refrigerant, raising it's temperature and pressure.
        </p>

      <div class="solution-box" id="box3">
        <h2>Refrigerant Lines</h2>
        <p>The warmed indoor air is distributed throughout the building via a forced-air system, ductwork, or radiant heating, providing warmth to the living spaces.</p>

            <p>
              It's important to note that since heat pumps primarily rely on electricity to power their operation, their environmental footprint depends on the source of electricity generation. When powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or hydroelectric power, heat pumps can operate with minimal carbon emissions, further enhancing their environmental benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
              This being said, having heat pumps installed in your house is a relatively simple undertaking. It's best to research different types suitable for your home and consulting with HVAC professionals to assess your needs. Work with an HVAC contractor to secure necessary permits and ensure compliance with local regulations. Once preparations are complete, installation can begin, which involves connecting indoor and outdoor units, along with any ductwork.

            <h2>What does it cost?</h2>
            <p>
              The cost of heat pumps can vary in size depending on where you live, the size of the system, the type of system and cost of building permits in your local municipality.
              Typically, Air-source heat pumps (the most common one) have a unit cost of $2,000-5,000 and an installation cost of $1,300-2,000.
              More expensive heat pumps like a Geothermal heat pump can cost $3,000-$6,000 per unit and a hefty $10,000-$20,000 for installation.
              Luckily, you can help reduce the cost of your heat pump installation with up to 30% ($2000) in tax credits.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you don't one already, you'll also have to install ductwork around your house to connect the inside and outside units. 
              This can incur an additional $1,500-$8,000 depending on the size of your house. 
              You may also have to pay for air duct cleaning if your ductwork hasn't received maintenance in a long time.
