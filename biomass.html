            <h2>What is Biomass Energy?</h2>
            <p>
              Biomass energy harnesses the power stored in organic materials, such as wood, agricultural crops, and waste, to generate heat or electricity. Through the utilization of biomass, organic matter undergoes combustion or conversion processes to release energy for various applications. This solution involves the collection and processing of biomass materials, which are then burned or converted in specialized facilities to produce heat or electricity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Earth's biomass reserves offer a significant renewable energy source, with vast quantities of organic matter available for sustainable utilization. Estimates suggest that biomass could potentially supply a substantial portion of global energy demand, with an abundance of resources available for conversion. Unlike fossil fuels, biomass fuels are typically CO2 neutral, only emitting the CO2 absorbed during the growth phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the <a href =  "https://www.eia.gov/kids/energy-sources/biomass/#:~:text=Biomass%20provided%20about%205%25%20of,(or%204.9%20quadrillion%20Btu)." style = "text-decoration: none; color: green;">US Energy Information Administration</a>, biomass currently accounts for approximately 
              5% of U.S. electricity generation from all sources in 2020. The adoption of biomass energy is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by advancements in technology and increasing recognition of its environmental benefits. As economies strive to reduce their carbon footprint and transition towards cleaner energy sources, biomass energy stands as a key component of the renewable energy landscape, poised to play a significant role in the future energy mix.

        <h2>Wood Pellets</h2>
        <p>
          Pellets are a processed form of wood, which make them much more condensed and uniform, and therefore more efficient. The pellets are stored and automatically fed into the boiler by hopper.

      <div class="solution-box" id="box2">
        <h2>Boiler</h2>
        <p>
          A biomass boiler works in a very similar way to conventional boilers, combusting fuel to produce heat that is then used to heat water. Biomass boilers are normally substantially bigger than traditional boilers since the boiler needs to be larger to hold the larger volume of fuel.

      <div class="solution-box" id="box3">
        <h2>Heat Exchange</h2>
        <p>
          The heat generated from the combustion process is transferred to a heat exchanger or boiler vessel. Water or another heat transfer fluid circulates through the heat exchanger, absorbing the heat from the biomass combustion.

            <p>
              Biomass plays a crucial role in waste management by providing a sustainable solution for organic waste disposal. Organic waste materials, such as agricultural residues, food scraps, and forestry residues, can be converted into biomass energy through various processes like anaerobic digestion, combustion, and gasification. By utilizing biomass energy, organic waste that would otherwise contribute to landfills and environmental degradation can be repurposed to generate heat, electricity, or biofuels.

              For homeowners, accessing biomass energy typically involves installing <a href =  "https://www.caluweinc.com/products/heizomat-ak-series-biomass-boilers-call/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA84CvBhCaARIsAMkAvkLWsxJbsRlHVSV3mLML7fG6jLsn1UaA64_zk0ixboKtVl1WejUqt6saAj1JEALw_wcB" style = "text-decoration: none; color: green;">Biomass Heating Systems</a> that utilize wood pellets, wood chips, or other biomass fuels to provide heat for their homes. These systems operate similarly to traditional heating systems but use renewable biomass fuels instead of fossil fuels.
              It can be installed with minimal modifications to an existing heating system.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, you may wish to install an automatic feed hopper on your biomass boiler. This hopper stores a large amounts of the wood pellets that are then automatically fed into the boiler as required, meaning that the boiler needs to be refuelled very infrequently (typically monthly).

            <h2>What does it cost?</h2>
            <p>
              Automatically-fed wood pellet burning biomass heaters can cost anywhere from $12-20,000. However, smaller domestic boilers with limited capabilities can start at $5000.
              If you are able to feed them manually, the price can further be reduced to $5-8,000. Not to mention, tax rebates can cover up to $5,000 for larger boilers.
            </p>
            <p>
              It might seem like a more expensive option compared to a $2,500 gas boiler, but once installed, a biomass boiler (4.2¢/kWh) can be cheaper to run than gas (5¢/kWh), oil (6.1¢/kWh) and electricity (13.4¢/kWh). They are generally cheaper, more efficient, and more sustainable in the long run.
