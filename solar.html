            <h2>What is Solar Energy?</h2>
            <p>
              Through the use of solar panels, energy originating from the sun can be used to power homes. This solution involves the use of specialized panels installed on the roof of a house which capture rays from the sun. Photovoltaic cells within the solar panels generate electrical charges thus converting sunlight into a usable form of energy. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The Earth's capacity to harness solar energy is immense, with an estimated absorption of approximately 122 petawatts per year, equivalent to 3,850,000 exajoules annually. This staggering figure underscores the vast potential of solar energy as a renewable resource that can power our planet sustainably. Remarkably, as of 2002 (2019), the energy absorbed from the sun in just one hour surpassed the total energy consumption of the entire world for an entire year, highlighting the abundance and potency of solar energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the <a href =  "https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=50357" style = "text-decoration: none; color: green;">US Energy Information Administration</a>, solar power accounted for 3% of U.S. electricity generation from all sources in 2020. However, it is projected that solar generation will make up 14% of the U.S. total in 2035 and 20% in 2050. This has been fueled in part by falling installation costs and increased interest in solar energy.

              One factor to consider with solar power is the reliance on energy from the sun. While solar panels can still function to some extent during the night time or under cloudy conditions, they would not generate as much power as they would during a sunnier day. As a result, their effectiveness may vary somewhat throughout different regions of the world or even seasonally. Furthermore, the direction that the roof of a house points would also impact how much solar power can be produced, based on the angle that the sun is facing. However, energy generated from solar panels can also be stored in batteries for later use even at night, making it highly beneficial in areas where weather permits.

              <a href = "https://www.energysage.com/solar/solar-panel-installation-guide-what-should-you-expect/" style = "text-decoration: none; color: green;">The process of installing solar panels</a> is often performed by qualified installers, and includes obtaining specific permits. Prior to the actual installation, it is necessary that a house is evaluated to determine whether it is advisable for that home to begin utilizing solar power. Once this analysis concludes, the attachment and connections of the solar panel to the home's electrical circuitry begin, with this step usually taking only a few days.

            <h2>What does it cost?</h2>
            <p>
              Solar panels can be costly to install, and prices vary based on where you live, the size of the system, the type of solar panels, and rebates offered in the state. 
              They usually cost around $17,500 to $24,640, although ultimately they prove very effective in reducing the cost of electricity in homes. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep in mind the figure presented earlier only applies to the average house. Solar panels cost between $2.40 and $3.60 per watt including installation, so how much you pay for your system depends on how many watts you need to keep your home powered.
              Local and state incentives can make a difference in the cost of your solar panel system too. For example, some local governments offer incentive programs that can reduce the cost of your solar panels by $2,500 or more.
              On an average $18,150 solar panel system, you'll save approximately $5,400 on your solar panels, putting your final price at around $12,700.
