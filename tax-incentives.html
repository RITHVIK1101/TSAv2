          </li>
          <li>

            financial relief.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Production Incentive Program:</strong> The Production
            Incentive Program (Renewable Energy System Cost Recovery) ensures
            that homeowners receive payments based on the electricity their
            solar panels generate over a specified period, further incentivizing
            solar energy production.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Federal Incentives:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC):</strong> The federal
            Solar ITC allows homeowners to claim a tax credit of up to 26% of
            the total cost of installing solar panels, covering expenses related

          </li>
          <li>

            in subsequent years.
